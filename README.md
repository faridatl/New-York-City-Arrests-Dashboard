# New-York-City-Arrests-Dashboard


In this repository the New York City Police Department arrest history records from the years 2017 to 2019 in the 5 different boroughs was explored. PySpark and Power BI were utilized to determine the arrest records for each borough as well as which demographic held the highest arrest record for each borough. Along with the perpetrators race and sex, the highest offense committed was determined as well. The results showed Black people held the highest number of arrests for each borough within New York City with Brooklyn being home to the highest and had “Dangerous Drugs” as the offense with the highest arrest record.

The arrest data was collected using only one source, New York City Open Data which is publicly available data that is being using to explore the arrest history in the five different boroughs of New York City. Open Data received the dataset from the Police Department (NYPD).


The dataset has 19 columns and 747K rows. The data type in the file is mainly text and numeric. The features in the dataset will provide us with great insight into who is committing the crimes and where they are taking place. One of the main objectives of this project is to analyze which of the 5 boroughs has the highest crime record. To achieve this, features such as race, gender, age, location, etc. will be needed.
